# Humaid's QSL Log


## Description

This is my amateur radio logbook, it shows the latest QSOs and allows people I
had contact with to query their log.

## Usage

This project includes a Nix development shell, which pulls in the required
version of Go. It also includes the application as a Nix package.

To run the application:

```
nix run
```

To load development shell:

```
nix develop
```
